## [0.0.5] - 2025-12-20

### Changed

- Preserve existing `memory/constitution.md` when upgrading. The constitution template is now stored in `templates`, not `memory`, to allow this.


## [0.0.4] - 2025-12-19

### Changed

- Bundled `templates/`, `scripts/`, and `memory/` into the CLI wheel and generate agent command files locally during `speclite init` without GitHub downloads.
- Removed unused `--skip-tls` and `--github-token` options from `speclite init`.
- Removed unused GitHub template download helpers from the CLI.
- Simplified `speclite version` to show a single CLI version value.
- Removed unused `httpx` and `truststore` dependencies from the CLI package.
- Removed template package release workflow/scripts now that templates are bundled.
- Removed `docs/local-development.md` in favor of `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## [0.0.3] - 2025-12-19

### Changed

- Added support for multiple AI agents in a project:
  - `speclite init --ai` accepts comma-separated agents and install templates for each selection.
  - The interactive UI supports multi-select for AI agents (defaults to none).

## [0.0.2] - 2025-12-19

### Changed

- Split template packaging into a core archive plus agent-specific archives, and install both during init.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-12-17

### Changed

- Started SpecLite as a fork of GitHub Spec Kit, taking the latest code as of https://github.com/github/spec-kit/commit/9111699cd27879e3e6301651a03e502ecb6dd65d (Spec Kit version 0.0.22 in `CHANGELOG.md`, released in https://github.com/github/spec-kit/releases/tag/v0.0.90). Will add new updates from Spec Kit from time to time.
